# 🚀 Agentic AI

Build intelligent systems that work autonomously toward goals. Learn how agents differ from simple prompts and explore graph-based workflows for reliable AI reasoning.

## 📚 Notebooks in This Section

### 1. From Prompts to Agentic AI Systems
**File:** `06_intro_to_agentic_ai.ipynb`

Introduction to agentic AI—AI systems that can work autonomously toward goals, not just respond to individual prompts. Learn how agents differ from simple prompts.
