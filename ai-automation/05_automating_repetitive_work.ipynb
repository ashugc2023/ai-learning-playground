    "- **Data entry and formatting**: Copying, pasting, reformatting\n",
    "- **Email responses**: Similar questions, similar answers\n",
    "- **Report generation**: Same structure, different data\n",

    "- **Information extraction**: Pulling data from documents\n",
    "- **Scheduling and coordination**: Finding times, sending reminders\n",

    "These tasks are perfect candidates for automation because they're:\n",
    "- Repetitive (same steps each time)\n",
    "- Rule-based (follow clear patterns)\n",
    "- Time-consuming (take up valuable hours)\n",
    "- Error-prone (humans make mistakes when bored)\n"
