    "\n",
    "You have two main options:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended for Beginners)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** A free online service where you can run notebooks in your web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ No installation needed\n",
    "- ✅ Works on any computer\n",
    "- ✅ Free to use\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to share\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Requires internet connection\n",
    "- ❌ Can't use local models (like Ollama)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** Getting started quickly, trying things out, sharing with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Local JupyterLab (For Advanced Users)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it is:** Software you install on your computer to run notebooks locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ Works offline\n",
    "- ✅ Can use free local models (Ollama)\n",
    "- ✅ More control over your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Requires installation\n",
    "- ❌ More setup steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** Using free local models, working offline, advanced customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which Should You Choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **New to coding?** Start with Google Colab\n",
    "- **Want to use free local models?** Use Local JupyterLab\n",

    "\n",
    "When you use AI, you have two main options:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paid APIs (OpenAI, Gemini)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- You send your request to a company's servers\n",
    "- Their powerful computers process it\n",
    "- You pay per use (usually very affordable)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ Very powerful models\n",
    "- ✅ Fast responses\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to use\n",
    "- ✅ Works in Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Costs money (usually cents per request)\n",
    "- ❌ Requires internet\n",
    "- ❌ Need an API key\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** Production work, when you need the best quality, quick results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free Local Models (Ollama)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- You download a model to your computer\n",
    "- Your computer processes the request\n",
    "- Completely free, runs offline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ Completely free\n",
    "- ✅ Works offline\n",
    "- ✅ No API keys needed\n",
    "- ✅ Your data stays local\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Requires powerful computer\n",
    "- ❌ Slower than paid APIs\n",
    "- ❌ Less powerful models\n",
    "- ❌ Only works locally (not in Colab)\n",

    "### 1. Try the Creator Starter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know how notebooks work, try building something useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next notebook:** `notebooks/001_creator_marketer_starter.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Generates hooks, captions, hashtags, and video angles for your content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use it:**\n",
    "1. Open the notebook (in Colab or locally)\n",
    "2. Run all cells (just like you did here)\n",
    "3. Fill in your content details (audience, niche, topic, etc.)\n",
    "4. Get instant content ideas!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Learn About Agentic AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're comfortable with basic AI calls, explore **agentic AI notebooks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is agentic AI?** AI that can make decisions, use tools, and work autonomously—not just answer questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- AI that researches topics for you\n",
    "- AI that creates multi-step content workflows\n",
    "- AI that automates repetitive tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where to find them:** Look for notebooks with \"agentic\" in the name or path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Build Your Own Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: **Notebooks are templates!**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Duplicate any notebook you like\n",
    "- Change the inputs to match your needs\n",
    "- Run it to get your results\n",
    "- Save the outputs for your content pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Share and Collaborate\n",
    "\n",
    "- Share your notebooks with team members\n",
    "- Use Colab for easy sharing (just send a link)\n",
    "- Keep your API keys secret (never share them!)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Quick Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Provider Options:**\n",
    "- `\"openai\"` - Paid, powerful, works everywhere\n",
    "- `\"gemini\"` - Paid, powerful, works everywhere  \n",
    "- `\"ollama\"` - Free, local only, needs installation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "- `llm(\"your prompt\")` - Send a prompt, get a response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security:**\n",
    "- Always use `getpass()` for API keys\n",
    "- Never commit keys to Git\n",
    "- Never share notebooks with visible keys\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting Help:**\n",
    "- Check the README.md for detailed setup instructions\n",
    "- Review other notebooks for examples\n",
